# eld-dfhack-scripts
My Crazy Dwarf Fortress Scripts (primary purpose... 'creations' -they are just scripts)

Archive of things I've touched (secondary purpose... edits and internet paste-ins)

Archive of things I like (tertiary... or a rename of a script or a function shift away from how I crappily use it. Posterity!)

SLIGHT WARNING
Good news. These are all the same versions in my play directory of DF with DFHack 43.0X
That does not mean they all WORK. Tread carefully.
